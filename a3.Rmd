##Research Goal

"The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances." - Wikipedia.

The aim of this project is to create a nice visualization about Nobel Prize Winners and their different publications.  This project will be using Rstudio.  The Dataset can be found in **TidyTuesday's Github**(https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-14). I hope you enjoy this. :) 

##What is the Nobel Prize? 

"On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace – the Nobel Prizes. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Learn more about the Nobel Prize laureates here." - NobelPrize.org.  Alfred Nobel gave SEK 31 million of his own money, around SEK 1,7 billion now, for investments in "safe securities", where the income will be distributed to the future winners. Nobel Prize is created for those with the greatest benefit to mankind.  

For those worthy, the nobel prize bounty can be divided from two to three persons. The Nobel Prize started around 1901 up til now, my data set will be exploring the 1901 winners and their publications up til 2016. There will be some years when the Nobel Prizes were not awarded due to the World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945), and the prizes here will be reserved for the future awards.

##Why are they called "Nobel Laureates"?

![Nobel Laureate](/Users/abigailchristinechen/data_visualization_2/Images/NobelLaureate.jpg)

Apparently, this stems from Greek Mythology, and a Greek god named Apollo. According to Wikipedia, Apollo is one of the most important and complex god in Greek mythology and he is recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. Apollo wears a laurel wreath on his head, it's made of leaves and branches of the bay laurel turned into a circular crown. In Ancient Greece, this laurel wreath is given and awarded to the champions and victors of the athletic and literary competitions. 


##What will the Nobel Laureates receive once they are chosen? 

![Nobel Diploma](/Users/abigailchristinechen/data_visualization_2/Images/NobelDiplomaSample.jpg)

First they will get a Nobel Prize diploma, made especially for them.  They will get unique artworks created by the best Swedish and Norweigian artists and calligraphers. All handmade and fully customized. Second they will get a Nobel Prize Medal handmade with 18 carat recycled gold.  This medal has the portrait of Alfred Nobel, and his lifetime years. Third, they will be getting the Nobel Prize document indicating the amount they will get.

The aim of this project is to create a visualization about Nobel Prize Winners and their different publications.  This project will be using RstudIO.  The Dataset can be found in **TidyTuesday's Github**(https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-14).

##Defining the theme

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, include = TRUE}
##Defining the theme

theme_nobel <- function(){ 
    font <- "Calibri"   #assign font family up front
    
    theme_bw() %+replace%    #replace elements we want to change
    
    theme(
      
      legend.position = "top",            #legend position
      panel.background = element_blank(),  # panel background to NA
      panel.border = element_blank(),              # setting panel border
      
      #grid elements
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),    #remove major gridlines
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),    #remove minor gridlines
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),          #remove axis ticks
      
      #plot elements
      plot.title = element_text(             #title
                   family = font,            #set font family
                   size = 12L,               #set font size
                   face = 'bold',            #bold typeface
                   hjust = 0.5,              #left align
                   vjust = 2),               #raise slightly
      
      plot.caption = element_text(           #caption
                   family = font,            #font family
                   size = 8,                 #font size
                   hjust = 0.5),               #right align
      
      #axis elements
      axis.text = element_text(              #axis text
                   family = font,            #axis famuly
                   size = 8),                #font size
      
      axis.title = element_text(             #axis titles
                   family = font,            #font family
                   size = 8),               #font size
    )
}
```


##Data Cleaning 

To clean the data, I transformed the birth_date column to a year, month, day format. I also did the same for the death_date column. I also added the birth_year column from the birth_date.  I used this to create the age column which is the difference of the prize_year and the birth_year. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Checking the formats
str(nobel_winners)
str(nobel_winner_all_pubs)
```

```{r setup, message = FALSE, include=TRUE}
#Transforming to data.table
nobel_winners <- as.data.table(nobel_winners)
nobel_winner_all_pubs  <- as.data.table(nobel_winner_all_pubs)

#Transforming to date format
##For prize_year
#nobel_winners <- nobel_winners[, prize_year:= year(prize_year)]

#Adding birth year
nobel_winners  <- nobel_winners[, birth_year := year(birth_date)]

#For birth_date
nobel_winners <- nobel_winners[, birth_date := ymd(birth_date)]

#For death_date
nobel_winners <- nobel_winners[, death_date := ymd(death_date)]

#Creating the birth_year and age
nobel_winners$birth_year <- as.numeric(nobel_winners$birth_year)
nobel_winners$age <- nobel_winners$prize_year - nobel_winners$birth_year
```

```{r setup, message = FALSE, include=TRUE}
#checking the formats again
str(nobel_winners)
str(nobel_winner_all_pubs)
```
